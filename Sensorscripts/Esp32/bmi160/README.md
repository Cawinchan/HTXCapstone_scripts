## Sensor output

### Accelerometer

Currently the sensor outputs acceleration in 14bits (LSB), which for a sensor range of `2g` (default) (+/-2g), would need to be divided by `2**14` to get the `g` values ([see more here](https://community.bosch-sensortec.com/t5/MEMS-sensors-forum/BMI160-Accelerometer-Range/td-p/18748)). This `g` values would further need to be translated to `m/s2` by the following formula (`g * 9.80665`).

### Gyroscope

The sensor outputs the angular velocity in `degrees/s`, (-180, 180). If you need `rad/s`, you would need to multiply with `pi/180`. 

### Sensortime

Sensortime is the number of clock cycles, in a 39Âµs resolution time stamp generated by a real-time clock. See [here](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/product_flyer/bst-bmi160-fl000.pdf). To get the relative time in seconds, you would need to multiply by `39/1000000.0`.

## Caveats

The API that DFRobot has is similar to the API that is provided by Bosch. To unlock more functionalities, one would have to edit the library accordingly.
